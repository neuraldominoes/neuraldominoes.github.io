## Interesting short reads I read - April

### [The Problem with Wanting Less](https://whateverhappened.substack.com/p/stop-trying-to-curate-everything)
"I think I want a quiet life." Honestly, I've lost track of how many 2 AM scrawls in my Notes have begun with this quiet despair ridden phase. I have reused it to the point where it has begun to sound rather absurd when contrasted with the chaos of real life. I think it's really interesting that it's managed to solidify the amalgamation of recurrent disjoint feelings into a sense of 'wanting to make our life feel lived in'. 
Phrasing it this way is actually really cool, because we now have a direct contradiction to our problem. You can't have a "cosy well lived in life" unless...you actually live. *wow,shocker, huh?* Well, it really isn't that obvious, I suppose, but hey, I finally got to see someone else put into words something that has been plaguing me for a long time and that's enough catharisis in itself. 
To put it as succintly as a yapper as myself possibly can, living is messy and attempting to fit one's living into an aesthetic is simply not possible and rather works against the solidification of the hazy ideals of "settling into a life", ideals that we perhaps subconsciously set out to achieve when we decided to attempt such a boxing in. 

###[The Prism](https://www.gurwinder.blog/archive)
Interesting stuff about tech and psychology and the information age.
